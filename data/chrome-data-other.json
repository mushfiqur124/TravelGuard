Bat Lyssavirus in Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau Rabies has not been reported on these islands; therefore most travellers are considered to be at low risk. However, bats may carry bat lyssavirus (bat rabies). Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with bats. Bites from bats are frequently unrecognised. Rabies-like disease caused by bat lyssaviruses is preventable with prompt post-exposure rabies management. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Although rabies has not been reported in other animals in this country, it is sensible to seek prompt medical advice if bitten or scratched. It is possible, although very rare for bats to pass rabies like viruses to other animals including pets. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide. Pre-exposure rabies vaccinations are recommended for those who are at increased risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus and those working with bats).

Dengue in Côte d'Ivoire There is a risk of dengue in this country.Information on current outbreaks, where available, will be reported on our outbreak surveillance database.Prevention Travellers should avoid mosquito bites, particularly during daytime hours. Dengue vaccination Vaccination can be considered for individuals aged 4 years of age and older who have had dengue infection in the past and who are: travelling to areas where there is a risk of dengue infection or areas with an ongoing outbreak of dengue, or are exposed to dengue virus through their work, such as laboratory staff working with the virus Exceptionally, vaccination can be considered in those who have not had dengue in the past. In these situations, further expert advice should be considered. Detailed guidance on how to ascertain previous infection is available in the UK Health Security Agency Immunisation against infectious disease the 'Green book'. The final decision on vaccination rests with the health professional and the traveller after a detailed risk assessment has been performed and the potential risks of vaccination explained.Dengue in brief","prevention":"Travellers should avoid mosquito bites, particularly during daytime hours."},{"n":"Hepatitis B","d":"Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a viral infection spread through blood, semen and vaginal fluids.

The mosquitoes that spread dengue are more common in towns, cities and surrounding areas. Dengue in French Polynesia There is a risk of dengue in this country.Information on current outbreaks, where available, will be reported on our outbreak surveillance database.Prevention Travellers should avoid mosquito bites, particularly during daytime hours. Dengue vaccination Vaccination can be considered for individuals aged 4 years of age and older who have had dengue infection in the past and who are: travelling to areas where there is a risk of dengue infection or areas with an ongoing outbreak of dengue, or are exposed to dengue virus through their work, such as laboratory staff working with the virus Exceptionally, vaccination can be considered in those who have not had dengue in the past. In these situations, further expert advice should be considered.

Although many different animals can transmit the virus, most cases follow a bite or scratch from an infected dog. In some parts of the world, bats are an important source of infection. Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do, the condition is almost always fatal. The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick. Rabies in Israel Rabies is considered a risk and has been reported in domestic animals in this country. Bats may also carry rabies-like viruses.

See UK Health Security Agency Immunisation against infectious disease, the 'Green Book'. For travellers, BCG vaccine is recommended for: Unvaccinated, children under 16 years of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. A tuberculin skin test is required prior to vaccination for all children from 6 years of age and may be recommended for some younger children. Unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test-negative individuals at risk due to their work such as healthcare or laboratory workers who have direct contact with TB patients or potentially infectious clinical material and vets and abattoir workers who handle animal material, which could be infected with TB. There are specific contraindications to BCG vaccine. Health professionals must be trained and assessed as competent to administer this vaccine intradermally. Following administration, no further vaccines should be administered in the same limb for 3 months. The BCG vaccine is given once only, booster doses are not recommended.Tuberculosis in brief","prevention":"Travellers should avoid close contact with individuals known to have infectious pulmonary (lung) or laryngeal (throat) TB.

Tuberculosis (BCG) vaccination BCG vaccine is recommended for those at increased risk of developing severe disease and/or of exposure to TB infection. See UK Health Security Agency Immunisation against infectious disease, the 'Green Book'. For travellers, BCG vaccine is recommended for: unvaccinated, children under 16 years of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. A tuberculin skin test is required prior to vaccination for all children from 6 years of age and may be recommended for some younger children. unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test-negative individuals at risk due to their work such as healthcare or laboratory workers who have direct contact with TB patients or potentially infectious clinical material and vets and abattoir workers who handle animal material, which could be infected with TB. There are specific contraindications to BCG vaccine. Health professionals must be trained and assessed as competent to administer this vaccine intradermally. Following administration, no further vaccines should be administered in the same limb for 3 months. The BCG vaccine is given once only, booster doses are not recommended.

Bat Lyssavirus in Tonga Rabies has not been reported in this country; therefore most travellers are considered to be at low risk. However, bats may carry bat lyssavirus (bat rabies). Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with bats. Bites from bats are frequently unrecognised. Rabies-like disease caused by bat lyssaviruses is preventable with prompt post-exposure rabies management. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Although rabies has not been reported in other animals in this country, it is sensible to seek prompt medical advice if bitten or scratched. It is possible, although very rare for bats to pass rabies like viruses to other animals including pets. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide. Pre-exposure rabies vaccinations are recommended for those who are at increased risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus and those working with bats). Pre-exposure vaccines could be considered for those whose activities put them at increased risk of exposure to bats. Rabies in brief","prevention":"Travellers should avoid contact with bats.

Bat Lyssavirus in Turks and Caicos Rabies has not been reported in this country; therefore most travellers are considered to be at low risk. However, bats may carry bat lyssavirus (bat rabies). Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with bats. Bites from bats are frequently unrecognised. Rabies-like disease caused by bat lyssaviruses is preventable with prompt post-exposure rabies management. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Although rabies has not been reported in other animals in this country, it is sensible to seek prompt medical advice if bitten or scratched. It is possible, although very rare for bats to pass rabies like viruses to other animals including pets. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide. Pre-exposure rabies vaccinations are recommended for those who are at increased risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus and those working with bats). Pre-exposure vaccines could be considered for those whose activities put them at increased risk of exposure to bats. Rabies in brief","prevention":"Travellers should avoid contact with bats.

Hepatitis B in Yemen This country is considered to have an intermediate or high prevalence of hepatitis B.Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with blood or body fluids. This includes: Avoiding unprotected sexual intercourse. Avoiding tattooing, piercing, public shaving, and acupuncture (unless sterile equipment is used). Not sharing needles or other injection equipment. Following universal precautions if working in a healthcare or other higher risk setting. A sterile medical equipment kit may be helpful when travelling to resource poor areas.Hepatitis B vaccination Vaccination could be considered for all travellers and is recommended for those whose activities or medical history put them at increased risk. This includes: Those who may have unprotected sex. Those who may be exposed to contaminated needles through injecting drug use. Those who may be exposed to blood or body fluids through their work (e.g. health and aid workers). Those at high risk of requiring medical or dental procedures or hospitalisation e.g. those with pre-existing medical conditions, those who may require travelling for medical care abroad, or those travelling to visit families or relatives.
