The disease can also be transmitted if the saliva of an infected bat gets into open wounds or mucous membranes (such as on the eye, nose or mouth). Bat lyssaviruses can cause disease in humans that is indistinguishable from rabies. Symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do the condition is almost always fatal. The risk to most travellers is low. However, it is increased for certain occupations for example bat handlers and veterinarians, or certain activities such as caving. Bat Lyssavirus in Galapagos Rabies has not been reported in this country; therefore most travellers are considered to be at low risk. However, bats may carry bat lyssavirus (bat rabies). Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with bats. Bites from bats are frequently unrecognised. Rabies-like disease caused by bat lyssaviruses is preventable with prompt post-exposure rabies management.

Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick. Rabies in USA Most travellers to this country are considered to be at low risk for rabies. However some animals may pose a greater risk of rabies for travellers, e.g. skunks, racoons and foxes. Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country. Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with wild animals including bats. Rabies is preventable with prompt post-exposure management. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Although rabies has not been reported in domestic animals, it is still sensible to seek prompt medical advice if bitten or scratched by all animals. Post-exposure management following contact with wild animals, including bats, should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination Pre-exposure vaccines could be considered for those who are at increased risk of exposure to wild animals especially foxes and bats.
