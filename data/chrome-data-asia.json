For travellers, BCG vaccine is recommended for: Unvaccinated, children under 16 years of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. A tuberculin skin test is required prior to vaccination for all children from 6 years of age and may be recommended for some younger children. Unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test-negative individuals at risk due to their work such as healthcare or laboratory workers who have direct contact with TB patients or potentially infectious clinical material and vets and abattoir workers who handle animal material, which could be infected with TB. There are specific contraindications to BCG vaccine. Health professionals must be trained and assessed as competent to administer this vaccine intradermally. Following administration, no further vaccines should be administered in the same limb for 3 months.

A tuberculin skin test is required prior to vaccination for all children from 6 years of age and may be recommended for some younger children. Unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test-negative individuals at risk due to their work such as healthcare or laboratory workers who have direct contact with TB patients or potentially infectious clinical material and vets and abattoir workers who handle animal material, which could be infected with TB. There are specific contraindications to BCG vaccine. Health professionals must be trained and assessed as competent to administer this vaccine intradermally.

Those at risk during their work (such as healthcare workers) should take appropriate infection control and prevention precautions.Tuberculosis (BCG) vaccination BCG vaccine is recommended for those at increased risk of developing severe disease and/or of exposure to TB infection. See UK Health Security Agency Immunisation against infectious disease, the 'Green Book'. For travellers, BCG vaccine is recommended for: Unvaccinated, children under 16 years of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. A tuberculin skin test is required prior to vaccination for all children from 6 years of age and may be recommended for some younger children. Unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test-negative individuals at risk due to their work such as healthcare or laboratory workers who have direct contact with TB patients or potentially infectious clinical material and vets and abattoir workers who handle animal material, which could be infected with TB. There are specific contraindications to BCG vaccine. Health professionals must be trained and assessed as competent to administer this vaccine intradermally. Following administration, no further vaccines should be administered in the same limb for 3 months. The BCG vaccine is given once only, booster doses are not recommended.Tuberculosis in brief","prevention":"Travellers should avoid close contact with individuals known to have infectious pulmonary (lung) or laryngeal (throat) TB.

The final decision whether or not to advise antimalarials rests with the travel health advisor and the traveller after individual risk assessment.\nTravellers with an absent or poorly functioning spleen should be dissuaded from travel to any area with risk of malaria.

Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide.Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put them at increased risk including: those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for infected patients). those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical care is limited. those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling. long-stay travellers (more than one month).

Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with all animals. Rabies is preventable with prompt post-exposure treatment. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide. Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put them at increased risk including: those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for infected patients). those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical care is limited. those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling. long-stay travellers (more than one month).

Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do, the condition is almost always fatal. The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick. Rabies in Indonesia Rabies is considered a risk and has been reported in domestic animals in this country. Bats may also carry rabies-like viruses. Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with all animals. Rabies is preventable with prompt post-exposure management. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide.Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put them at increased risk including: those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for infected patients). those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical care is limited. those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling. long-stay travellers (more than one month).

Although many different animals can transmit the virus, most cases follow a bite or scratch from an infected dog. In some parts of the world, bats are an important source of infection. Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do, the condition is almost always fatal. The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
