Travellers should not eat or drink any unpasteurised milk products.Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination Vaccination is recommended for those visiting affected areas whose activities put them at increased risk including: Living in TBE risk areas. Working in forestry, woodcutting, farming and the military. Visiting forested areas and urban parks, e.g. camping, fieldwork, hiking and hunting. Laboratory workers who may be exposed to TBE.

Occasionally cases of TBE occur after consumption of raw (unpasteurised) milk or dairy products from infected animals (e.g. cows, goats and sheep).

This includes urban parks and woodland areas in cities. Ticks are usually most active between early spring and late autumn.

The disease can also be transmitted if the saliva of an infected bat gets into open wounds or mucous membranes (such as on the eye, nose or mouth). Bat lyssaviruses can cause disease in humans that is indistinguishable from rabies. Symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do the condition is almost always fatal.

Although many different animals can transmit the virus, worldwide most cases follow a bite or scratch from an infected dog. Bats are also an important source of infection in some countries. Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do the condition is almost always fatal. The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick. Rabies in Spain There is risk of rabies in the African territories of Ceuta and Melila in Spain. Rabies has not been reported in domestic or wild animals in the rest of Spain (including the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands); therefore most travellers are considered to be at low risk. However, bats may carry bat lyssavirus (bat rabies). Prevention Travellers to the African territories of Ceuta and Melila should avoid contact with animals. For other areas in Spain travellers should avoid contact with bats. Bites from bats are frequently unrecognised.

It is possible, although very rare for bats to pass rabies like viruses to other animals including pets. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination For travellers to the African territories of Ceuta and Melila: Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put them at increased risk including: those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for infected patients). those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical care is limited. those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling. long-stay travellers (more than one month). For those travelling to other areas in Spain: Pre-exposure rabies vaccinations are recommended for those who are at increased risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus and those working with bats). Pre exposure vaccines could be considered for those whose activities put them at increased risk of exposure to bats. A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide.
