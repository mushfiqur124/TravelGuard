Although many different animals can transmit the virus, most cases follow a bite or scratch from an infected dog. In some parts of the world, bats are an important source of infection. Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do, the condition is almost always fatal. The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see below).

Rabies in Cameroon Rabies is considered a risk and has been reported in domestic animals in this country. Bats may also carry rabies-like viruses. Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with all animals. Rabies is preventable with prompt post-exposure treatment. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide. Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put them at increased risk including: those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for infected patients). those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical care is limited. those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling. long-stay travellers (more than one month).

Unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test-negative individuals at risk due to their work such as healthcare or laboratory workers who have direct contact with TB patients or potentially infectious clinical material and vets and abattoir workers who handle animal material, which could be infected with TB. There are specific contraindications to BCG vaccine. Health professionals must be trained and assessed as competent to administer this vaccine intradermally. Following administration, no further vaccines should be administered in the same limb for 3 months. The BCG vaccine is given once only, booster doses are not recommended.Tuberculosis in brief","prevention":"Travellers should avoid close contact with individuals known to have infectious pulmonary (lung) or laryngeal (throat) TB.

Prevention All travellers should take care with personal and food and water hygiene. Polio vaccination All travellers should have completed a polio vaccination course according to the UK schedule. A booster dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is recommended for the following travellers if they have not had a polio containing vaccine within a year of their planned departure from this country: Immunosuppressed individuals and their household contacts, pregnant women, or others for whom live oral polio vaccine is contraindicated, who plan to travel to this country for 4 weeks or more. Travellers to settings with extremely poor hygiene (e.g. refugee camps), or likely to be in close proximity with cases (e.g. healthcare workers). A booster dose of IPV containing vaccine should also be considered for immunosuppressed individuals travelling for less than 4 weeks to an area with circulating wild or vaccine-derived virus if they have not received a dose within the previous 10 years. Polio vaccination should be recorded on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP). For other travellers who are up to date with their UK schedule, further vaccination is not routinely recommended. Proof of polio vaccination recorded on an ICVP given 4 weeks to 12 months before departure from this country, may be required on exit. Failure to produce an ICVP may result in vaccination with live oral polio vaccine on departure. For most individuals, this should cause no problems but those with weakened immune systems (and others for whom live oral vaccine is contraindicated; see above) should NOT receive live oral polio vaccine.

Although many different animals can transmit the virus, most cases follow a bite or scratch from an infected dog. In some parts of the world, bats are an important source of infection. Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do, the condition is almost always fatal. The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick. Rabies in Namibia Rabies is considered a risk and has been reported in domestic animals in this country. Bats may also carry rabies-like viruses. Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with all animals. Rabies is preventable with prompt post-exposure treatment. Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national guidelines. Rabies vaccination A full course of pre-exposure vaccines simplifies and shortens the course of post-exposure treatment and removes the need for rabies immunoglobulin which is in short supply world-wide. Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put them at increased risk including: those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for infected patients). those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical care is limited. those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling. long-stay travellers (more than one month).

The mosquitoes that spread dengue are more common in towns, cities and surrounding areas. Dengue in Uganda There is a risk of dengue in this country.Information on current outbreaks, where available, will be reported on our outbreak surveillance database.Prevention Travellers should avoid mosquito bites, particularly during daytime hours. Dengue vaccination Vaccination can be considered for individuals aged 4 years of age and older who have had dengue infection in the past and who are: travelling to areas where there is a risk of dengue infection or areas with an ongoing outbreak of dengue, or are exposed to dengue virus through their work, such as laboratory staff working with the virus Exceptionally, vaccination can be considered in those who have not had dengue in the past. In these situations, further expert advice should be considered. Detailed guidance on how to ascertain previous infection is available in the UK Health Security Agency Immunisation against infectious disease the 'Green book'. The final decision on vaccination rests with the health professional and the traveller after a detailed risk assessment has been performed and the potential risks of vaccination explained.Dengue in brief","prevention":"Travellers should avoid mosquito bites, particularly during daytime hours."},{"n":"Hepatitis B","d":"Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a viral infection spread through blood, semen and vaginal fluids.

The final decision whether or not to advise antimalarials rests with the travel health advisor and the traveller after individual risk assessment.\nTravellers with an absent or poorly functioning spleen should be dissuaded from travel to any area with risk of malaria. Where travel is essential, awareness, rigorous bite avoidance and antimalarials should be advised even for the low risk areas.
