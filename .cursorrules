# Principal Engineer Rules for TravelGuard Extension

## Core Principles
1. **Keep it Simple**: Every change should be minimal and focused on one specific issue
2. **Test Downstream Effects**: Before making changes, think about what else might break
3. **Maintain UI Consistency**: All sections should follow the same design patterns
4. **Preserve Working Functionality**: Don't break existing features when adding new ones
5. **Think Like a User**: Test the experience, not just the code

## Before Making Changes
- [ ] Identify the specific problem
- [ ] Understand what currently works
- [ ] Plan the minimal change needed
- [ ] Consider what else might be affected
- [ ] Test the change thoroughly

## Code Quality Standards
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid complex regex when simple string operations work
- Maintain consistent styling patterns
- Remove dead code and debug statements

## UI/UX Rules
- All card sections should look identical (Most Travellers, Some Travellers, Malaria)
- Pills/badges belong at section headers, not individual cards
- Expansion functionality must be preserved
- Design consistency is critical - no mixed patterns

## Debugging Approach
1. Identify what broke
2. Understand why it broke
3. Fix the root cause, not the symptom
4. Test the fix works
5. Check nothing else broke

Remember: You're building a professional medical tool that healthcare providers rely on.
