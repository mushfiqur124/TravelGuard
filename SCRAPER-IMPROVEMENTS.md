# Enhanced Scraper for Complete Accordion Content

## Problem Identified

The original scraper was only capturing the collapsed/visible text content from TravelHealthPro accordion elements using `element.textContent.trim()`. This meant we were missing critical detailed information that becomes visible when accordions are expanded, such as:

- Country-specific risk information ("Chikungunya in Thailand")
- Detailed prevention guidelines  
- Vaccination recommendations with specific criteria
- Links to additional resources
- Outbreak surveillance information

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Accordion Detection
- Added `isAccordionElement()` method to identify accordion/collapsible content
- Detects accordion indicators: classes, ARIA attributes, clickable elements, hidden content
- Searches for common accordion patterns used by TravelHealthPro

### 2. Complete Content Extraction
- New `extractFullAccordionContent()` method captures ALL content including hidden sections
- `getAllTextContent()` method extracts text from hidden elements (display:none, aria-hidden, etc.)
- Preserves HTML structure and formatting for better display

### 3. Structured Content Parsing
- Parses content into structured sections: description, country-specific, prevention, vaccination, risk factors
- `extractSubsections()` identifies and extracts headed sections within accordions
- Pattern matching for common TravelHealthPro content structures

### 4. Enhanced Data Structure
New vaccine data format includes:
```javascript
{
  name: "Chikungunya",
  description: "Basic description...",
  countrySpecific: "Chikungunya in Thailand - specific risk info...",
  prevention: "Travellers should avoid mosquito bites...", 
  vaccination: "Vaccination may be considered for...",
  riskFactors: ["Long-term travellers", "Rural areas"],
  additionalSections: [
    {heading: "Outbreak Information", content: "..."},
    {heading: "Additional Resources", content: "..."}
  ]
}
```

### 5. Updated Extension Display
- Enhanced sidebar.js to display the new structured data
- Separate sections for country info, prevention, vaccination, risk factors
- Better formatting and organization of accordion content
- Color-coded sections for easy identification

### 6. Improved Extraction Methods

#### Enhanced `parseVaccineFromHeading()`:
- Handles accordion/collapsible content in following elements
- Extracts country-specific information patterns
- Captures vaccination details and additional sections
- Preserves all content types (paragraphs, lists, divs)

#### Enhanced `extractVaccineFromElement()`:
- Multiple strategies for vaccine name extraction
- Accordion-aware content extraction
- Fallback to original logic for non-accordion elements
- Better error handling and content validation

## Key Features

### Accordion Content Extraction
- Detects and expands accordion elements
- Extracts content from hidden/collapsed sections
- Preserves original formatting and structure
- Handles nested accordions and complex layouts

### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies "Disease in Country" patterns
- Extracts prevention advice automatically
- Finds vaccination recommendations
- Captures risk factor lists

### Content Structuring
- Organizes content into logical sections
- Maintains hierarchical information structure
- Preserves relationships between headings and content
- Enables better display in the extension

## Testing

Use the test script to verify improvements:

```bash
node test-enhanced-scraper.js
```

This will specifically test Thailand's Chikungunya data and show:
- Amount of content captured vs. original
- Presence of country-specific information
- Vaccination details
- Additional sections found
- Complete structured output

## Expected Results

For Thailand Chikungunya, you should now see:

1. **Basic Description**: "Chikungunya is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes..."
2. **Country Information**: "There is a risk of chikungunya in this country..."
3. **Prevention**: "Travellers should avoid mosquito bites, particularly during daytime hours"
4. **Vaccination**: "Vaccination may be considered for individuals aged 12 years..."
5. **Additional Info**: Links to outbreak surveillance, detailed recommendations

This represents a significant improvement from the previous truncated description that was missing most of the detailed accordion content.

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/scraper.js` - Enhanced extraction methods
2. `content-scripts/sidebar.js` - Updated display logic
3. `content-scripts/content.css` - New styling for structured content
4. `test-enhanced-scraper.js` - Test script for verification

## Benefits

- **Complete Information**: Captures all accordion content including hidden sections
- **Better Organization**: Structured data enables better UX in the extension
- **Formatted Display**: Preserves the original formatting intent from the source
- **Extensible**: Framework supports future enhancements and new content types
- **Reliable**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure content is captured even if site structure changes
